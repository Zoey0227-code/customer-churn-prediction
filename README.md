Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts which telecom customers are most likely to churn (leave) based on demographic and usage data. This project highlights skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to support customer retention strategies.

🔑 Key Features

Data ingestion & preprocessing

Merged customer demographics and usage datasets on customer_id.

Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical features.

Modeling & evaluation

Built classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Compared performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Insights

Identified high-impact factors such as contract type, tenure, and data usage.

Provided interpretable results to guide retention campaigns and reduce churn.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

📂 Project Structure
telecom_demographics.csv   # Customer demographic info
telecom_usage.csv          # Customer usage data
customer_churn.ipynb       # End-to-end analysis and modeling notebook

🚀 Outcome

✔ Demonstrated end-to-end machine learning workflow (data → model → insights)
✔ Produced interpretable models that help telecoms retain high-risk customers
✔ Showcased ability to connect data science methods with real business impact
